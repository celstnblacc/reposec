## Security design notes

`reposec` performs **read-only static analysis** — it reads files and matches patterns. It does not:
- Make network requests during scans
- Store, transmit, or log file contents
- Require elevated permissions
- Execute code from scanned repositories

Findings are printed to stdout or written to a local report file only.
